# Intro-Python-I

A collection of Python exercises from Lambda School that demonstrate Python syntax and language concepts.

## Instructions

Each directory inside the `src/` directory presents exercises revolving around a
particular concept in Python.

The suggested order for going through each of the directories is: 

* `hello` -- Hello world
* `bignum` -- Print some big numbers
* `datatypes` -- Experiment with type conversion
* `modules` -- Learn to import from modules
* `printing` -- Formatted print output
* `lists` -- Python's version of arrays
* `tuples` -- Immutable lists typically for heterogenous data
* `slices` -- Accessing parts of lists
* `comprehensions` -- List comprehensions
* `dictionaries` -- Dictionaries
* `functions` -- Functions
* `args` -- Arguments and Keyword Arguments
* `scopes` -- Global, Local, and Non-Local scope
* `file_io` -- Read and write from files
* `cal` -- Experiment with module imports and implement a text-based calendar
* `classes` -- Classes and objects

## Stretch Goals

1. One of Python's main philosophical tenets is its emphasis on readability. To
   that end, the Python community has standardized around a style guide called
   [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Take a look at it and
   then go over the code you've written and make sure it adheres to what PEP 8
   recommends.

2. Write a program to determine if a number, given on the command line, is prime.

    - Implement [The Sieve of
      Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), one
      of the oldest algorithms known (ca. 200 BC).

    - Think of ways to optimize the program.
